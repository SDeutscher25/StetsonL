				<h3>Michael Ross</h3>

				<h3>Who is Michael Ross?</h3>
				<p>
					Michael James Ross, played by Patrick J. Adams, is a lawyer, with an eidetic memory and the ability
					to absorb large amounts of printed material very rapidly, who never attended law school. While in
					college, he aspired to be a lawyer and even passed the bar examination on a dare. However, he was
					expelled after his friend Trevor Evans convinced him to memorize a calculus test and sell it in
					order to pay off Trevor's debts to a drug dealer, and they unknowingly sold the answers to the
					Dean's daughter, forcing the dean to resign under scrutiny, but not before revoking Mike's
					scholarship and expelling him. Since then, he began smoking marijuana and took the LSAT as a proxy
					for others to pay the nursing home bills of his grandmother, who raised him after his parents died
					when he was eleven. To keep his grandmother in the private nursing home, he agrees to deliver
					marijuana for Trevor. However, he discovers that the delivery is a sting operation, because he read
					a novel in elementary school that matched the situation. He escapes the police by accidentally
					slipping into the hotel room where Harvey Specter's interviews for prospective associate attorneys
					is taking place. He impresses Harvey with his encyclopedic knowledge of law (which is even better
					than Harvey's) and drive to become a better lawyer than any graduate of Harvard Law School, the only
					school from which the Pearson Hardman law firm hires.

				<h3>Harvey Specter</h3>

				<h3>Who is Harvey Specter?</h3>
				<p>
					Harvey Reginald Specter, played by Gabriel Macht, is a newly promoted senior partner at the
					prestigious New York law firm Pearson Hardman and is known as one of the city's top litigators. In
					the pilot episode, he is told of his promotion to senior partner—the youngest to hold that
					position—and is forced to hire a Harvard Law School graduate to be his associate attorney. He is
					impressed with Mike Ross' quick thinking and drive to be a good lawyer, as well as his inherent
					ability to absorb enormous amounts of information (his photographic memory) and his extensive
					knowledge of law. Mike, however, does not have a law degree, but is hired anyway because Harvey does
					not want to waste time interviewing less-promising candidates. Mike reminds Harvey of a younger
					version of himself, and so they agree to conspire to pretend that Mike is, in fact, a Harvard
					graduate. He acts as Mike's mentor, as well as his immediate superior: although he performs these
					roles somewhat reluctantly and emotionally distantly at first, he later begins to show that he does
					care about Mike and Mike's future as a lawyer.

				<h3>Louis Litt</h3>

				<h3>Who is Louis Litt?</h3>
				<p>
					Louis Marlowe Litt, played by Rick Hoffman, is a partner at Pearson Hardman (later Pearson Specter
					Litt) who is the firm's leading authority and expert on all financial matters and the direct
					supervisor of the firm's associate attorneys.[1] He is self-serving and often bends rules to get
					what he wants, including faking a positive drug test to blackmail Mike Ross. He is overly pedantic,
					jealous to the point of paranoia, highly suspicious, snobbish, and cruel. Louis would be considered
					a "wanna be" person. Louis often fails to understand how he appears to others, honestly surprised to
					find people hold grudges over his behavior and that he can be hurtful. However, he highly values
					loyalty to his colleagues and the firm. Unlike Harvey, who is known to almost always prefer
					settlements to trials, Louis believes that trials are not necessarily a bad thing. He is known to be
					the firm's highest billing attorney in terms of hours, and has a strong work ethic, on one occasion
					proving it by finishing the associates' monthly work in a single evening.

				<h3>Donna Paulsen</h3>
				<img src="donna.jpg" alt="Donna" />
				<h3>Who is Donna Paulsen?</h3>
				<p>
					Donna Roberta Paulsen, played by Sarah Rafferty, is Harvey Specter's legal secretary, close friend,
					and confidant.[1] She has worked with him since his first year as an Assistant District Attorney,
					and she left the DA's office with him to work with him at Pearson Hardman. She listens in on all the
					conversations in his office, partially because he never turns the intercom off. She knows the
					private details of his personal life and relationships. She is also an integral part of Harvey's
					pre-trial ritual. She was promoted to the post of Chief Operating Officer of the firm in season 7.
