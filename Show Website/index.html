				<div class="paragraph1">
					<p>
						Patrick J. Adams as Michael James Ross (main seasons 1–7; recurring season 9): Mike is hired by
						Harvey Specter to be his associate, despite not having a license to practice law. In season 5,
						Mike gets caught, and, to protect Jessica Pearson, Harvey, and Louis Litt, he takes a deal to
						serve two years in prison. In season 6, Mike takes a deal to get out early and – in the season
						finale – passes the bar so that he can legally practice law. He marries Rachel Zane and moves to
						Seattle in the season 7 finale. He returns in season 9 to help Harvey, Louis, Alex, and Samantha
						oust Faye Richardson from the firm.

						Gabriel Macht as Harvey Reginald Specter: The best closer in the city and Jessica Pearson's
						right-hand. Harvey has been a name partner since the firm was named "Pearson Darby Specter" but
						resigns from "Specter Litt Wheeler Williams" in season 9. He marries Donna Paulsen in the series
						finale and moves to Seattle with Mike Ross and Rachel Zane.

				<div class="paragraph3">
					<p>
						Rick Hoffman as Louis Marlowe Litt: Initially a junior partner at Pearson Hardman, Louis’s
						self-serving and underhanded tactics often mask his deep passion for the law and the firm’s
						success. While admiring Harvey Specter, he struggles with jealousy over Harvey’s charisma and
						his close bond with Jessica Pearson. In season 4, Louis uses Mike Ross’s secret to strong-arm
						Jessica into naming him a partner, creating Pearson Specter Litt. As managing partner of "Litt
						Wheeler Williams Bennett," Louis evolves into a loyal and compassionate leader, treating the
						firm’s members like family. Married to Sheila Sazs, with whom he welcomes their daughter, Lucy
						Litt, in the series finale, Louis embraces both personal and professional growth. Known for
						mentoring associates with his tough yet effective style, Louis takes immense pride in shaping
						their careers. His transformation, highlighted by his iconic catchphrase, “You just got Litt
						up!” makes him one of the show’s most dynamic and beloved characters.

					<p>
						Sarah Rafferty as Donna Roberta Paulsen: Harvey Specter's former secretary and confidante. She
						goes to work for Louis Litt as his secretary in season 5 but later returns to Harvey. She is one
						of the only people alongside Louis, Harvey, Jessica Pearson, Rachel Zane, and Benjamin to stay
						at Pearson Specter Litt after Mike Ross is caught and sentenced to prison for two years for
						practicing law without a degree. In season 7, she becomes the COO of PSL. Due to Donna's
						mishandling of client/boyfriend Thomas Kessler in season 8, Daniel Hardman puts a case on Zane
						Specter Litt Wheeler Williams, which results in Robert Zane taking the fall for Donna's mistake
						and Zane getting disbarred. Harvey and Donna get together by Season 8's end and get married in
						the series finale.
