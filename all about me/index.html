        <h2>Why am I Interested in Coding?</h2>
        <p>
            I am interested in coding because it could be something I can do in the future, and it is also fun to learn.
            Coding is a useful thing to know as well. In a future career, I could end up using coding to do my work as
            well, so it would be very useful for me to know the basics atleast.

        <h3>My Hobbies and Interests</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                One of my interests is <span style="font-weight: 900">video games.</span> My favourite one is War
                Thunder and it is a military game.
            </li>
            <li>
                Another one of my hobbies/interests is watching the
                <span style="font-weight: 900">NFL, NBA, and some soccer as well</span>. All of them are just
                interesting sports to watch and to root for my favourite teams.
            </li>
            <li>
                Lastly, one of my interests is
                <span style="font-weight: 900">hanging out with my friends and family.</span> I usually play video games
                with my friends after school, then I go and watch movies or just hang out with my family.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Future Goals</h4>
        <p>
            In the future I would probably like to do something in a trade, something like plumbing. I believe that they
            are good jobs and are pretty reliable with hiring. Those jobs also seem like something that I might enjoy
            doing, its hands-on. Another career I could go into is with computers, since I like using them.
