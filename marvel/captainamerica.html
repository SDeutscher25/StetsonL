            Captain America is a superhero created by Joe Simon and Jack Kirby who appears in American comic books
            published by Marvel Comics. The character first appeared in Captain America Comics #1, published on December
            20, 1940, by Timely Comics, a corporate predecessor to Marvel. Captain America's civilian identity is Steve
            Rogers, a frail man enhanced to the peak of human physical perfection by an experimental "super-soldier
            serum" after joining the United States Army to aid the country's efforts in World War II. Equipped with an
            American flag-inspired costume and a virtually indestructible shield, Captain America and his sidekick Bucky
            Barnes clashed frequently with the villainous Red Skull and other members of the Axis powers. In the final
            days of the war, an accident left Captain America frozen in a state of suspended animation until he was
            revived in modern times. He resumes his exploits as a costumed hero and becomes leader of the superhero team
            the Avengers, but frequently struggles as a "man out of time" to adjust to the new era.
        </p>

        <p style="font-size: 20px">
            The character quickly emerged as Timely's most popular and commercially successful wartime creation upon his
            original publication, though the popularity of superheroes declined in the post-war period and Captain
            America Comics was discontinued in 1950. The character saw a short-lived revival in 1953 before returning to
            comics in 1964, and has since remained in continuous publication. Captain America's creation as an
            explicitly anti-Nazi figure was a deliberately political undertaking: Simon and Kirby were stridently
            opposed to the actions of Nazi Germany and supporters of U.S. intervention in World War II, with Simon
            conceiving of the character specifically in response to the American non-interventionism movement. Political
            messages have subsequently remained a defining feature of Captain America stories, with writers regularly
            using the character to comment on the state of American society and government.
        </p>

        <p style="font-size: 20px">
            Having appeared in more than ten thousand stories in more than five thousand media formats, Captain America
            is one of the most popular and recognized Marvel Comics characters, and has been described as an icon of
            American popular culture. Though Captain America was not the first United States-themed superhero, he would
            become the most popular and enduring of the many patriotic American superheroes created during World War II.
            Captain America was the first Marvel character to appear in a medium outside of comic books, in the 1944
            serial film Captain America; the character has subsequently appeared in a variety of films and other media,
            including the Marvel Cinematic Universe, where he was portrayed by actor Chris Evans from the character's
            first appearance in Captain America: The First Avenger (2011) to his final appearance in Avengers: Endgame
            (2019).

    <p style="font-size: 20px">
        Chris Evans retired from his role as Captain America after Avengers: Endgame, but his character still holds a
        special place in the hearts of fans. Other original Avengers like Iron Man and Black Widow have also left the
        MCU, raising questions about why Evans is no longer around.
