            Iron Man is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by
            <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bolder">Marvel Comics</span>. Co-created by writer and editor
            <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bolder">Stan Lee</span>, developed by scripter
            <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bolder">Larry Lieber</span>, and designed by artists
            <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bolder">Don Heck</span>
            and <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bolder">Jack Kirby</span>, the character first appeared in
            <span style="font-weight: bolder">Tales of Suspense #39</span> in 1963, and received his own title with Iron
            Man #1 in 1968. Shortly after his creation, Iron Man was a founding member of a superhero team, the
            <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bolder">Avengers</span>, with Thor, Ant-Man, Wasp and the
            Hulk. Iron Man stories, individually and with the
            <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bolder">Avengers</span>, have been published consistently
            since the character's creation.

        <p style="font-size: 20px">
            Iron Man is the superhero persona of
            <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bolder">Anthony Edward "Tony" Stark</span>, a businessman and
            engineer who runs the company <span style="font-style: italic">Stark Industries</span>. Beginning his career
            as a weapons manufacturer, he is captured in a war zone, and his heart is severely injured by shrapnel. To
            sustain his heart and escape his captors, he builds a technologically advanced armor. After escaping, he
            continues using the armor as a superhero, creating more advanced models that grant him superhuman strength,
            flight, energy projection, and other abilities. The character was used to explore political themes, and
            early Iron Man stories were set in the Cold War. Later stories explored other themes, such as civil unrest,
            technological advancement, corporate espionage, alcoholism, and governmental authority.
        </p>

        <p style="font-size: 20px">
            Major Iron Man stories include <span style="font-style: italic">Demon in a Bottle</span> (1979),
            <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bolder">Armor Wars</span> (1987–1988),
            <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bolder">Extremis</span> (2005), and
            <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bolder">Iron Man 2020</span> (2020). He is also a leading
            character in the company-wide stories
            <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bolder">Civil War</span> (2006–2007),
            <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bolder">Dark Reign</span> (2008–2009), and
            <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bolder">Civil War II</span> (2016). Iron Man's supporting cast
            has produced additional superhero characters, including
            <span style="font-style: italic"
                >James Rhodes as War Machine, Pepper Potts as Rescue, and Riri Williams as Ironheart</span
            >
            as well as reformed villains <span style="font-style: italic">Black Widow and Hawkeye</span>. Iron Man's
            list of enemies includes his archenemy, the <span style="font-style: italic">Mandarin</span>, as well as
            many supervillains of communist origin and many that double as business rivals for Stark.

        <p style="font-size: 20px">
            <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bolder">Robert Downey Jr.</span> portrayed Tony Stark in
            <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bolder">Iron Man</span> (2008), the first film of the
            <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bolder">Marvel Cinematic Universe</span>, and continued to
            portray the character until his final appearance in
            <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bolder">Avengers: Endgame</span>
            (2019). Downey's portrayal popularized the character, elevating Iron Man as one of Marvel's most
            recognizable superheroes.
