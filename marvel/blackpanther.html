            Black Panther is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by
            writer-editor Stan Lee and artist-coplotter Jack Kirby, the character first appeared in Fantastic Four #52,
            published in July 1966. On Earth-616, Black Panther's birth name is T'Challa, and he is the son of the
            previous Black Panther, T'Chaka. He is the king and protector of the fictional African nation of Wakanda, a
            technologically advanced society drawing from a supply of vibranium, a fictional metal of extraordinary
            properties. Along with possessing enhanced abilities achieved through ancient Wakandan rituals of drinking
            the essence of the heart-shaped herb, T'Challa also relies on his proficiency in science, expertise in his
            nation's traditions, rigorous physical training, hand-to-hand combat skills, and access to wealth and
            advanced Wakandan technology to combat his enemies. The character became a member of the Avengers in 1968,
            and has continued that affiliation off and on in subsequent decades.

            The storylines of the 1970s written by Don McGregor were critically acclaimed and introduced T'Challa's
            nemesis Erik Killmonger. These stories also engage with significant social issues of the time, such as the
            resurgence of the Ku Klux Klan in the U.S. state of Georgia. A subsequent story addressed the issue of
            apartheid in South Africa. However, Black Panther was a somewhat neglected character of low popularity until
            his reinvention by Christopher Priest in the late 1990s. Priest re-emphasized the importance of Wakanda as
            an independent and technologically advanced African nation. Priest also introduced the Dora Milaje, Black
            Panther's female bodyguards. In subsequent series written by Reginald Hudlin, T'Challa married Storm of the
            X-Men. Hudlin's stories emphasize Black cultural pride and achieved greater commercial success. In Hudlin's
            era, the role of Black Panther and leadership of Wakanda was also temporarily given to T'Challa's sister
            Shuri while he was briefly in a coma. While T'Challa and Storm's marriage was annulled in a subsequent
            storyline, their relationship has continued in other narratives. The Black Panther comics became
            particularly commercially successful in 2016, partly as a result of the literary fame of their writer, the
            journalist and essayist Ta-Nehisi Coates. The first issue of his series was the best-selling comic book of
            that month. Coates's series call into question the legitimacy of monarchy in Wakanda and articulate a more
            democratic vision.

            Black Panther is the first Black superhero in American mainstream comics. The character is also an early
            example of the Afrofuturist aesthetic. He has made numerous appearances in various television shows,
            animated films, and video games. Chadwick Boseman portrayed T'Challa in Phase Three of the Marvel Cinematic
            Universe's films: Captain America: Civil War (2016), Black Panther (2018), Avengers: Infinity War (2018),
            and Avengers: Endgame (2019). He also voiced alternate versions of the character in the first season of the
            animated series What If...? (2021), which was released after his death. The Black Panther film was a notable
            critical and popular success. Letitia Wright's character Shuri, who had appeared in previous MCU films, took
            on the Black Panther mantle in Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (2022), following Boseman's death in 2020.

        <h3>Cultural Impact and Legacy</h3>
        <p>
            Black Panther became widely popular since the release of the film Black Panther in 2018. Many sources have
            commended the significance of the character, particularly with regard to the representation of Black people.
            For example, Anubhav Chaudhry of Sportskeeda described Black Panther as a "powerful, regal, and intelligent
            black hero," writing, "The introduction of the Black Panther in 1966 marked a pivotal moment in the history
            of comic books, opening the doors for diverse characters to enter the mainstream." Laura Bradley of Vanity
            Fair included Black Panther in their "Stan Lee's Most Iconic Characters" list, describing him as the "first
            superhero of African descent in the comics world." Fred Bluden of Screen Rant asserts, "As a technological
            genius, diplomat, statesman, and superhero, Black Panther helped to encourage the creation of other
            prominent black superheroes who were more than stereotypes. As a character, and a cultural milestone, his
            importance cannot be overstated." The A.V. Club ranked Black Panther 1st in their "100 Best Marvel
            Characters" list. Joseph J. Darowski, in the introduction to The Ages of Black Panther: Essays on the King
            of Wakanda, argues that "The Black Panther's place in popular culture history is secured even as it is
            constantly evolving." Darren Franich of Entertainment Weekly ranked Black Panther 26th in their "Let's Rank
            Every Avenger Ever" list, writing, "The Black Panther has one of the most interesting backstory/mythologies
            in comic books." Wizard Magazine ranked Black Panther 79th in their "200 Greatest Comic Book Character of
            All Time" list.

            In 2020, following the death of Chadwick Boseman, Disneyland unveiled a mural at Anaheim's Downtown
            representing the actor giving the Wakanda salute to a young fan wearing a Black Panther mask. In 2021, a wax
            figure of T'Challa / Black Panther was unveiled at Madame Tussauds London, inspired by the Marvel Cinematic
            Universe (MCU) incarnation of the character. In 2022, BuyCostumes.com announced that T'Challa's Black
            Panther costume was the 8th most popular Halloween costume for kids.
